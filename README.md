### Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.7.0
* Rails 5.2.4
*Postgres: >=9.5
* SQLite3
* Node.js
* Yarn


### Setup and Install

* Open your terminal - Windows: `Win + R`, then type `cmd` | Mac: `Command + space`, then type `Terminal`
* Navigate to a directory of your choosing using the `cd` command
* Run this command in your OS terminal: `git clone git@github.com:kiranitor123/private-events.git` to get a copy of the project
* Navigate to the project's directory using the `cd` command
* Migrate the database to your environment by running `rails db:migrate`
* Run `rails webpacker:install` to configure Webpacker for your environment. Otherwise, an error like `Webpacker::Manifest::MissingEntryError` will appear if you attempt to run the server.
* Install dependencies by running `bundle install`
* Execute `rails server` to fire up the server
* Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to get into the app
* Interact with the app using the links in the nav bar. To access private pages, sign up by clicking the `Sign Up` link
* Interact with the app
* To close the server, enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal

### API Endpoints

* To list all posts:

Input this link in request url: `http://localhost:3000/api/posts`

Status: 200 OK should be displayed and all posts data should be showing up in the body.

* To list comments for given post:

Input this link in request url: `http://localhost:3000/api/posts/:post_id/comments`, where :post_id is the id for the post you are selecting.

Status: 200 OK should be displayed and all the comments data should be showing up in the body.

* To create comments:

Set your HTTP request to POST. Post requests are different from Get request as there is data manipulation with the user adding data to the endpoint.

You must first create a user to proceed. To do so, input this link in request url: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users`. Input your user information to include the keys "name", "email", "password", and "password_confirmation" in the body of the request. Ensure that the code has been copied correctly with paired curly braces and brackets. Send the request as JSON.

A token will be provided in the output. Copy the token and paste it into the box displayed by the "Bearer Token" option of the "Authorization" section. Input `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/posts/:post_id/comments` into the HTTP request, which is set to POST. Send the comment as JSON.

And finally you can create a new comment. The HTTP request should remain as `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/posts/:post_id/comments`, set to Post and the comment in JSON format. Input the comment with the "content" key and ensure that the code has been inputted correctly with paired curly braces and brackets.

Status: 201 Created should be displayed and posted data should be showing up in the body.
